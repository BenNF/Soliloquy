description: Elucidate is a research project focused on creating a user-friendly web application to assist users in understanding data and data collection practices. The goal of the Elucidate is to help data subjects in understanding the amassed data thereby guiding data subjects to think about the data controllers they trust and reflect on the terms and conditions. Elucidate takes advantage of the Right to Access and builds upon the Right to Data Portability given to data subjects by European Union's GDPR, and it presents user personal data, such as geolocation and media, in a depictive way.
